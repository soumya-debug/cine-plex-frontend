# NMS Cinemas - Movie Ticket Booking System

## Background of the Project

**NMS Cinemas** is a popular movie theater chain established in 2004 in Pune, India. Over the years, NMS Cinemas has become known for its wide variety of movies at affordable prices. However, since 2010, the company has seen a significant decline in sales, primarily due to the rise of digital platforms like **BookMyShow** and **Paytm**, which allow users to book tickets online, bypassing the need for intermediaries.

To counter this trend, NMS Cinemas decided to modernize their business model by developing an easy-to-use and visually appealing website that enables users to book movie tickets online. They hired a developer to create this platform, ensuring it aligns with the business needs and works seamlessly across devices. The project’s main goal is to provide a smooth, user-friendly interface for booking tickets while integrating backend services to manage movies, showtimes, and bookings.

- **Backend**: 
  - Spring Boot (Java) for RESTful API development
  - JWT for user authentication and authorization
  - MySQL for database management

- **Frontend**: 
  - Angular for the user interface
  - HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for frontend development

- **Build Tool**:
  - Maven for dependency management and project building

- **Payment Gateway**:
  - Integration with **Razorpay** or **Paytm** for secure payment processing

- **Deployment**:
  - Docker for containerization
  - NGINX as a reverse proxy for frontend and backend
  - Cloud-based deployment on platforms such as AWS or DigitalOcean
